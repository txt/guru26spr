# Week 5: CSC491 Review Notes — Documentation


## Part 1: Glossary

### Documentation Theory (Diátaxis)

**Diátaxis** — Procida's framework: 4 doc types from
  2 axes (action/cognition × acquisition/application)

**action vs cognition** — *knowing how* (practical
  doing) vs *knowing that* (theoretical thinking)

**acquisition vs application** — learning a new skill
  vs using an existing skill to get work done

**cognitive mismatch** — mixing doc types forces the
  reader's brain to switch between learning modes;
  causes confusion even when facts are correct

**tutorial** — acquisition + action; learning by
  doing; beginner is guided through a safe success

**how-to guide** — application + action; goal-oriented
  recipe; user knows what they want, needs the steps

**reference** — application + cognition; austere
  facts only; no teaching, no tutorials

**explanation** — acquisition + cognition; the "why";
  history, philosophy, trade-offs, mental models

---

### Reference Documentation

**type hint** — PEP 484 annotation declaring expected
  types of args and return value; does not affect
  runtime; enables IDE help and static analysis

**docstring** — string immediately after def/class;
  accessible as __doc__ at runtime; parsed by pdoc

**triple-quoted string** — uses """ or '''; avoids
  escaping apostrophes inside single-quoted strings;
  preferred for docstrings for this reason

**custom type alias** — e.g. Qty = int | float;
  gives a readable name to a complex type expression

**disjunction type** — A | B (Python 3.10+); value
  is either type A or type B

**Optional[T]** — shorthand for T | None; for args
  that may legitimately be absent

**Any** — typing escape hatch; accepts any data type;
  use when the type is genuinely unknown

**Iterable[T]** — anything loop-able (list, generator,
  set); T is the type of each yielded item

**pdoc** — auto-doc tool; reads docstrings and type
  hints; generates an alphabetical HTML reference
  site; ignores source-level section groupings

**Google-style docstring** — structured with Args:,
  Returns:, Raises: sections; parsed cleanly by pdoc

---

### How-To Documentation

**man page** — UNIX task recipe; sits on the
  Reference/How-To border; covers flags, args,
  examples, and file formats

**documentation as code** — Bell Labs mandate; docs
  written in plain text with macros, compiled like
  source; lives in the same file system as code

**groff / nroff / troff** — UNIX text-formatting
  macro languages; compiled man pages to terminal
  or print output; ancestor of LaTeX pipelines

**UNIX Programmer's Manual** — first released 1971;
  not a textbook; a set of ruthlessly efficient
  task recipes organised as man pages

**UNIX Documenter's Workbench (DWB)** — AT&T product
  built on groff; included eqn (math), tbl (tables),
  pic (diagrams); doc pipeline as composable tools

---

### Document Conversion (Pandoc)

**Pandoc** — document transpiler by philosophy
  professor John MacFarlane; parses input into an
  AST, then emits almost any output format

**Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** — format-neutral
  in-memory representation of a document's structure;
  information not in the AST is lost on conversion

**transpiler** — compiler that converts one high-
  level format to another (e.g. markdown → PDF)

**tectonic** — lightweight LaTeX engine; downloads
  only fonts/packages needed on demand; used by
  Pandoc for PDF generation without full LaTeX

**YAML frontmatter** — metadata block (---) at the
  top of a Pandoc markdown file; sets title, theme,
  author, Beamer slide options

**Beamer** — LaTeX document class for slide decks;
  Pandoc generates Beamer PDF from markdown via
  tectonic with one command

---

### Prompt Engineering for Documentation

**prompt as subroutine** — treating LLM prompts like
  reusable code; storing them in a library and
  applying to new functions or files

**meta-prompt** — asking the LLM mid-session:
  "give me the shortest prompt that reproduces
  what you just did"; captures the pattern for reuse

**prompt refinement** — iteratively adding constraints
  (e.g. "one-line docstring, 75 chars max") when
  the LLM over-generates

**LLM type hallucination** — AI infers overly
  restrictive types (e.g. forgets n could be "?");
  always verify generated type hints against real
  inputs before committing

---

### Tutorial Documentation

**REPL transcript** — interactive session log showing
  prompts (>>>), commands, and system outputs;
  primary artifact of a tutorial

**dribble transcript** — Bell Labs term for a REPL-
  style tutorial; starts with primitives, builds up;
  every step must produce visible correct output

**safe success principle** — tutorials must not
  introduce errors or edge cases; beginner
  confidence is the primary goal of the doc type

---

### Explanation Documentation

**K&R** — Kernighan & Ritchie, *The C Programming
  Language*; canonical explanation-level doc;
  short sentences, clean prose, recurring examples

**whole-to-parts structure** — show the full working
  program first, then explain its pieces; avoids
  "forward mystery" where terms appear undefined

**recurring anchor example** — K&R reuses the
  Fahrenheit converter across variables, loops,
  functions; reader sees the same thing grow in
  complexity rather than learning a new example
  each time

**Lions' Commentary** — John Lions' annotated listing
  of UNIX V6; 107 pages of commentary + 10,000-
  line code listing; starts with basics, builds up;
  taught for decades at UNSW

**"a program does not exist until documented"** —
  Bell Labs cultural mandate; documentation is an
  engineering deliverable, not an afterthought

---

 ## Part 2: Review Questions

**Q1 — Diátaxis Quadrants**

(a) Name the two axes of the Diátaxis framework
    and the four documentation types they produce.
    (2 min)

(b) Your team's README mixes: a step-by-step
    install guide, an explanation of the system's
    architecture, and a full API parameter list —
    all in one file. Using Diátaxis, identify the
    quadrant each section belongs to and explain
    why mixing them harms different reader types.
    (4 min)

---

**Q2 — Type Hints as Reference**

(a) What is a custom type alias in Python? Give
    one example using the | operator. (2 min)

(b) You are given this raw function:

      def score(d, lo, mid):
        return int(100*(1-(d-lo)/(mid-lo+1/BIG)))

    Write a version with: (i) custom type aliases,
    (ii) a one-line Google-style docstring ≤75
    chars, (iii) a correct return type annotation.
    Then explain why Optional[float] might be
    better than float alone. (4 min)

---

**Q3 — Triple Quotes and Docstring Conventions**

(a) What is the practical reason to prefer triple-
    quoted strings over single-quoted strings for
    one-line docstrings? (2 min)

(b) A colleague writes this docstring:

      def norm(num, n):
        'First, check if n is "?". If it is,
         return 0.0 immediately. Otherwise,
         compute a z-score by subtracting num.mu
         from n and dividing by the standard
         deviation. Then clamp z to [-3, 3] and
         pass it through a logistic function to
         get a value between 0 and 1. This is
         useful when you have outliers.'

    Using Diátaxis, identify what is wrong with
    this docstring's content and rewrite it
    correctly for the Reference quadrant. (4 min)

---

**Q4 — pdoc Limitations**

(a) What does pdoc generate, and what is its
    primary structural limitation compared to how
    code is organised in a source file? (2 min)

(b) A senior dev says "pdoc output = good docs."
    A new grad student cannot figure out how to
    load a CSV and run the optimizer. Using
    Diátaxis, diagnose the gap: which quadrant
    is pdoc satisfying, which two is it ignoring,
    and what artifact would fill each gap? (4 min)

---

**Q5 — Man Pages and Documentation as Code**

(a) What was Bell Labs' cultural mandate about
    documentation, and what does "documentation
    as code" mean technically? (2 min)

(b) How does a UNIX man page relate to the
    Diátaxis How-To quadrant? In what ways does
    it satisfy the definition, and in what ways
    does it also lean toward Reference? Use the
    structure of a typical man page (name, synopsis,
    options, examples) as your evidence. (4 min)

---

**Q6 — Pandoc and the AST**

(a) What is an Abstract Syntax Tree in Pandoc's
    pipeline? Give an example of the kind of
    information that gets lost when converting
    PowerPoint to Markdown and explain why. (2 min)

(b) Your team wants to ship documentation as both
    a modern HTML5 page and a Beamer PDF from a
    single Markdown source. Design the full Pandoc
    pipeline: input format, intermediate
    representation, two output commands, and the
    LaTeX engine needed. State one trade-off of
    this approach. (4 min)

---

**Q7 — Prompts as Subroutines**

(a) What does it mean to treat an LLM prompt as a
    "subroutine"? Give one example of how you
    would store and reuse it. (2 min)

(b) You spent a session getting an LLM to add type
    hints and a one-line docstring to one function.
    You now need the same result for 20 more
    functions. What do you ask the LLM at the end
    of the session, and what should the output
    look like so it works on a function the LLM
    has never seen before? (4 min)

---

**Q8 — Tutorial Structure (Dribble Transcripts)**

(a) What is a "dribble transcript" and what is
    the safe success principle for tutorials?
    (2 min)

(b) An LLM generates a REPL tutorial for xai.py
    that shows fabricated output values (e.g. a
    standard deviation of 3.14159). Why is this
    a problem for the specific audience a tutorial
    serves? What is the minimal fix, and why
    can't you just leave the numbers as-is even
    if they look plausible? (4 min)

 
**Q9 — Synthesis: Choosing the Right Doc Type**

(a) A new team member asks: "How do I run the
    optimizer on a CSV?" Which Diátaxis type do
    they need and what are its required
    components? (2 min)

(b) You have one hour to document xai.py for
    three audiences: (i) a manager evaluating
    adoption, (ii) a new grad student who has
    never run it, (iii) a contributor who needs
    to extend it. Assign one Diátaxis type to
    each, justify each choice, and identify which
    type pdoc partially covers and which it
    completely ignores. (4 min)
