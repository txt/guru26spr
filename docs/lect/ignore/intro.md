# Intro

Why study the craft of software engineering? Isn't that all uncessary
now in this new age of LLMs?

cause we are engineers and googd engineers know their tools better
than anyone else

cause, still.LLMs aren;t that good

cause in this age of LLMs, reviewing code is a power skill

cause when sh\*t happens, who you going to call?

- Cloudflare (Nov 2025): 3-hour web outage, ~$1.6B lost in trading volume.
- CrowdStrike (July 2024): Global Windows crash, ~$5.4B+ lost.

case doctors need to know more than search engines

cause of edge

cause of green

cause of pride

cause of backpacking

cause of supply chain dangers

cause it fights a congitive problem

cause of amazing discoveries



Motto: Own what matters (VITAL), skip what doesn't (YAGNI).

Why go lite? Because you don't want a manual— you want control. Not
helpless, but motivated and enabled.You'd rather fix friction than
live with it.  It can be better and you can make  it so. Such control
should be easy, fast, portable: minimal setup, no dependencies, no
root. Code should start, work, and leave nothing behind.

But control doesn't mean building everything. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna
Need It) says skip unnecessary features. VITAL (Vital Infrastructure:
Acquire Locally) says own what's critical. Your shell environment?
Critical. Every flag in ls or awk? Not critical.

When critical infrastructure lives elsewhere, you're exposed.
Remember left-pad? Supply-chain attacks? Richard Hipp, creator of
SQLite, understood this. He called it "backpacking"—carrying only
what you need. He nearly built on Berkeley DB until Oracle bought
it and started charging licensing fees.  But Hipp didn't care— he'd
already written his own engine. Now it's the most deployed database
in history. Self-reliance at scale.

My code is all about  lightweight control. I don't reboot or replace my OS— I refine,
then release, with nothing left behind. Containers add weight. Nix
adds complexity. Package managers promised simplicity; now we script
around them.

I like code that  is readable, portable, and teaches by showing: shell variables,
directories, temp files, small tools playing nicely. Each trick
opens a door to design and simplicity. Its methods can last decades.
Your parents could have written this; your kids might fix it. But
will they grasp (e.g.) .toml and why it is replacing setup.py?

So why wrestle chaos when control can be simple? Take the ell
