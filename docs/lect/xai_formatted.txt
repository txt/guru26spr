[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mxai.py [22mis a lightweight, zero‐dependency Python framework for multi‐ob‐
       jective  optimization.  Unlike "black box" AI models, it focuses on in‐
       terpretability by generating decision trees  that  isolate  the  "best"
       outcomes  ("heaven")  from  the rest.  It uses a recursive partitioning
       algorithm ("backpacking" code style) to cluster  data,  maximizing  the
       separation  between high‐scoring and low‐scoring rows based on weighted
       Euclidean distance to specific goals.


[1mDATA FORMAT[0m
       The input must be a CSV file. The first  row  (header)  defines  column
       roles using casing and suffixes:

       [1m[A‐Z]* (Starts with Uppercase)[0m
              Numeric columns (e.g., "Age", "Weight").

       [1m[a‐z]* (Starts with Lowercase)[0m
              Symbolic/Categorical columns (e.g., "job", "color").

       [1mname+ (Ends with +)[0m
              A numeric goal to [1mmaximize [22m(e.g., "Salary+").

       [1mname‐ (Ends with ‐)[0m
              A numeric goal to [1mminimize [22m(e.g., "Cost‐").

       [1mnameX (Ends with X)[0m
              A column to [1mignore [22m(e.g., "idX").

       [1m?      [22mDenotes a missing value in the data.


[1mOPTIONS[0m
