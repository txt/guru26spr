## Details

Lectures will be recorded.

|What               | Notes |
|:------------------|:------|
|Course Credit Hours| 3     |
|Course website     | [https://github.com/txt/guru26spr](https://github.com/txt/guru26spr) |
|Catalog Description| Other classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one missed subject: proficiency with their tools. Our motto: “be quiet or I will replace you with one tiny shell script”. |
|Textbook | None |
|Structure          | The majority of this course is synchronous, delivered through real-time, face-to-face class sessions. |
|Instructions       | Learning activities in this course will include  homework and in-class quizes and (for grad students) an end of semester team presentations|
|Tool used          | All grades will be recorded in Moodle.<br> All student work will be in Github (public GH, not the NCSU version).|
|Auditing           | not permitted |
|Attendance         | Mandatory but there are in-class quizzes. Also, all homeworks are handed in, on paper, by all members of a group. Anyone missing gets a cross. First three crosses cost nothing. After that, each cross is -1 mark. |
|Technical requirements | A laptop computer is required in each lecture for students taking this course.  NC State’s Online and Distance Education provides technology requirements and recommendations for computer hardware, and NC State’s Office of Information Technology provides recommendations for your computer . |


 Tools:

- The shell (e.g. bash, pipes,etc,)
- Shell Tools and Scripting (e,g, grep, sed,gawk, lua, etc)
- Editors (e.g. Micro, Vim, etc)
- AI assistants (gemini, claude, etc)
- Data Wrangling (regular expressions, julia)
- Command-line Environment  (tmux, zellij, etc)
- Version Control (Git)
- Debugging and Profiling
- Metaprogramming (make)
- Tiny databases
- Documentation (Latex,Pandoc, etc)

Topics: 

- YAGNI, KISS, DRY,  SOC, etc etc

Tasks:

- After some initialize exercises involving low-level tools, students will rewrite a small AI tool to multiple languages (LUA, Julia, Python) each time in a minimal way (extreme backpacking, lightweight as possible)
and then in a maximal way (go crazy on every advanced feature and package).




 


### Learning Outcomes

- Students will achieve a high level of expertise in  SE , mastery of the knowledge in that fields and the ability to apply this knowledge and graduate school experiences to critical research problems
- Students will apply SE  methods/tools to problems in SE  and describe the methods/tools effectively
- Graduate students will become independent researchers in SE developing a substantial expertise in that area that allows them to make an original contribution to it




## Assessment
 
- Ugrad students: teams of three: 6 homeworks 
- Grad students: teams of two: 4  homeworks and a two part assignment at end resulting in in-class presentations. 
- Homeworks: submit something one week, review someone else's next week.
- Weekly in-class quizes (2 marks each). If you miss any quizzes then for the first two misses, you get the mean
  mark scored by the rest of the class. After that, you score zero.
- Classes are in person. To ensure that, all submissions are in-person, by the whole group.
  Anyone missing gets a cross. First two crosses cost nothing. After that, each cross is -1 mark.
 

## Grades

Homeworks projects are printed submissions. 


Quizzes are on-line.


- In class quiz: 2 marks each (11 of those)
- Grad students: 4 homeworks and 1 project (13 marks for hw, 26 marks for hw)
  - 10 marks for an initial submission
  - 3 marks to review someone else's submission
- Ugrad students: 6 homewworks, 13 marks each
- Total: 100 marks

End of term there will be a optional exam for students who want to make up lost marks:

- Students can identity one submission of 11 marks and one submission of  13 marks that they would like to replace. 
- The Exam will be out 24 marks.
- The students' grades for the 11 and 13 will be replaced with the exam result **even if the exam grade is lower**.


With the final grades, the following grade scale will be used: 


     A+ (97-110),  A (93-97),   A-(90-92)
     B+ (87-89),   B (83-87),   B-(80-82)
     C+ (77-79),   C (73-77),   C-(70-72)
     D+ (67-69),   D (63-67),   D-(60-62)
     F (below 60).

### Late Marks


Submissions score one late mark per day (but only -1 for the weekend).


## Expectations for learner participation and interaction


- Work in public github (lets us browse and help debug yur code).

## Attendance

- Classes are in person. To ensure that, all submissions are in-person, by the whole group.
  Anyone missing gets a cross. First two crosses cost nothing. After that, each cross is -1 mark.
 

IF you need more time off than that, for events sanction by the university, contact the lecturer before time and other arrangements will be made.
Those sanctioned events are:


- The student is away from campus representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team.  These students would typically be accompanied by a University faculty or staff member.
- Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.
- Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per academic year for religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA) (go.ncsu.edu/absence). For more information about a variety of religious observances, visit the Diversity Calendar.
- Required military duty as certified by the student’s commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses for unanticipated absences must be reported to the instructor as soon as possible, but not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
  - Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
  - Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.   


Absence Verification: The [Absence Verification office](https://dasa.ncsu.edu/support-and-advocacy/find-help/absence-notification/) will provide student absence verification for deaths, legal obligations, military duty, and serious illnesses like surgery and hospitalizations.  


Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend  an office hours session.
There, students may be asked to review code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.


## Use of AI tools


Knock yourself out. Go to town. But remember, no AI in the quizzes. So make sure you understand what you did with the AI



## Other Student Expenses


No textbook.


Depending on what LLMs you use, this will incur a cost. Project teams should discuss how much they can spend, then plan accordingly. 


## Community guidelines 


- Use a respectful tone in all forms of communication (email, written, oral, visual).
- Maintain professionalism (avoid slang, poor grammar, etc.) in your written communication.
- Respect regional dialects and culturally embedded ways of oral communication.
- Stay home or in your dorm room if you are exhibiting symptoms of a contagious illness (fever, chills, etc.).
- Enter our virtual and/or physical classroom community respectfully by refraining from lewd or indecent speech or behavior, helping to maintain a safe physical environment, not using your cell phone for voice or text communication except when explicitly given leave to do so, and not attending class under the influence of any substance.
- Treat each community member with respect by not recording others without their consent or engaging in any form of hazing, harassment, intimidation, or abuse.
- Respect cultural differences that may influence communication styles and needs.]


## Disabilities


Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable
disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations,
students must register with the [Disability Resource Office (DRO)](https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/)
For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students
with disabilities, please see the 
[Policies, Rules and Regulations page maintained by the DRO](https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/about-us/policies-rules-regulations/)
and [REG 02.20.01 Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities](https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-01/).


## Academic Integrity


Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the i
[What is Academic Misconduct?](https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/).
Therefore, students are required to uphold the Pack Pledge: 
" “I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment,” on all syllabus, assignments, examinations, or other academic evaluations is encouraged."


Cheating will be punished to [the full extent possible](https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-misconduct/). 
Cheating
includes plagiarism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:


+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.


Students are encouraged to read each others code and report **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:


+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.


## Student Privacy


- In-class sessions are recorded in such a way that might also record students in this course.
- These recordings MAY be used beyond the current semester or in any other setting outside of the course.
- Contact your instructor if you have concerns.


## Syllabus Modification Statement


Our syllabus represents a flexible agreement. It outlines the topics we will cover and the order in which we will cover them. Dates for assignments represent the earliest possible time they would be due. The pace of the class depends on student mastery and interests. Thus minor changes in the syllabus can occur if we need to slow down or speed up the pace of instruction.
