1mNAME0m
       xai.py - explainable multi‐objective optimization using decision trees


1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1m./xai.py 22m[4mOPTIONS24m] [4mACTION24m] [4mFILE24m]


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mxai.py 22mis a lightweight, zero‐dependency Python framework for multi‐ob‐
       jective  optimization.  Unlike "black box" AI models, it focuses on in‐
       terpretability by generating decision trees  that  isolate  the  "best"
       outcomes  ("heaven")  from  the rest.  It uses a recursive partitioning
       algorithm ("backpacking" code style) to cluster  data,  maximizing  the
       separation  between high‐scoring and low‐scoring rows based on weighted
       Euclidean distance to specific goals.


1mDATA FORMAT0m
       The input must be a CSV file. The first  row  (header)  defines  column
       roles using casing and suffixes:

       1m[A‐Z]* (Starts with Uppercase)0m
              Numeric columns (e.g., "Age", "Weight").

       1m[a‐z]* (Starts with Lowercase)0m
              Symbolic/Categorical columns (e.g., "job", "color").

       1mname+ (Ends with +)0m
              A numeric goal to 1mmaximize 22m(e.g., "Salary+").

       1mname‐ (Ends with ‐)0m
              A numeric goal to 1mminimize 22m(e.g., "Cost‐").

       1mnameX (Ends with X)0m
              A column to 1mignore 22m(e.g., "idX").

       1m?      22mDenotes a missing value in the data.


1mOPTIONS0m
       Configuration flags control the internal algorithms.

       1m-b 4m22mbins0m
              Set  the number of bins for discretizing continuous values.  De‐
              fault is 1m722m.

       1m-B 4m22mBudget0m
              Set the max number of rows to evaluate during optimization.  De‐
              fault is 1m3022m.

       1m-C 4m22mCheck0m
              Set the number of guesses to check during stochastic search. De‐
              fault is 1m522m.

       1m-d 4m22mfile0m
              Set the default data file to load. Default is 1mdata.csv22m.

       1m-h     22mPrint the help message and exit.

       1m-l 4m22mleaf0m
              Set  the minimum size for leaf nodes.  The tree stops growing if
              a node has fewer than 4m224m 4m*24m 4mleaf24m rows. Default is 1m222m.

       1m-s 4m22mseed0m
              Set the random number generator seed. Default is 1m122m.


1mACTIONS0m
       Action flags trigger specific analysis routines.

       1m--all  22mRun all test suites and examples.

       1m--bins 22mShow the rankings of bins found in the data.

       1m--clone0m
              Test internal table replication logic.

       1m--csv  22mTest the CSV loader; prints raw parsed rows.

       1m--data 22mTest column generation; prints column statistics.

       1m--distx0m
              Sort/print rows by  distance  to  a  specific  row  (independent
              vars).

       1m--disty0m
              Sort/print rows by distance to "heaven" (dependent goals).

       1m--num  22mRun unit tests for the 1mNum 22mclass.

       1m--sym  22mRun unit tests for the 1mSym 22mclass.

       1m--tree 22mRun  the decision tree optimizer once and display the rule hier‐
              archy.

       1m--xais 22mRun the optimizer 20 times and display stability statistics.


1mEXAMPLES0m

                ./xai.py --tree data/auto93.csv

       1mRun stability analysis with a specific seed:0m
                ./xai.py -s 12345 --xais
