NAME

xai.py - explainable multi-objective optimization using decision trees

SYNOPSIS

./xai.py [OPTIONS] [ACTION] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION

xai.py is a lightweight, zero-dependency Python framework for
multi-objective optimization. Unlike "black box" AI models, it focuses
on interpretability by generating decision trees that isolate the "best"
outcomes ("heaven") from the rest. It uses a recursive partitioning
algorithm ("backpacking" code style) to cluster data, maximizing the
separation between high-scoring and low-scoring rows based on weighted
Euclidean distance to specific goals.

DATA FORMAT

The input must be a CSV file. The first row (header) defines column
roles using casing and suffixes:

[A-Z]* (Starts with Uppercase)

    Numeric columns (e.g., "Age", "Weight").

[a-z]* (Starts with Lowercase)

    Symbolic/Categorical columns (e.g., "job", "color").

name+ (Ends with +)

    A numeric goal to maximize (e.g., "Salary+").

name- (Ends with -)

    A numeric goal to minimize (e.g., "Cost-").

nameX (Ends with X)

    A column to ignore (e.g., "idX").

?

    Denotes a missing value in the data.

OPTIONS

Configuration flags control the internal algorithms.

-b bins

    Set the number of bins for discretizing continuous values. Default
    is 7.

-B Budget

    Set the max number of rows to evaluate during optimization. Default
    is 30.

-C Check

    Set the number of guesses to check during stochastic search. Default
    is 5.

-d file

    Set the default data file to load. Default is data.csv.

-h

    Print the help message and exit.

-l leaf

    Set the minimum size for leaf nodes. The tree stops growing if a
    node has fewer than 2 * leaf rows. Default is 2.

-s seed

    Set the random number generator seed. Default is 1.

ACTIONS

Action flags trigger specific analysis routines.

--all

    Run all test suites and examples.

--bins

    Show the rankings of bins found in the data.

--clone

    Test internal table replication logic.

--csv

    Test the CSV loader; prints raw parsed rows.

--data

    Test column generation; prints column statistics.

--distx

    Sort/print rows by distance to a specific row (independent vars).

--disty

    Sort/print rows by distance to "heaven" (dependent goals).

--num

    Run unit tests for the Num class.

--sym

    Run unit tests for the Sym class.

--tree

    Run the decision tree optimizer once and display the rule hierarchy.

--xais

    Run the optimizer 20 times and display stability statistics.

EXAMPLES

Generate a decision tree for a custom dataset:

  ./xai.py --tree data/auto93.csv

Run stability analysis with a specific seed:

  ./xai.py -s 12345 --xais

Debug data parsing:

  ./xai.py --csv data.csv
