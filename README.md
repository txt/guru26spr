Q: What is a software guru?     
A: First to get hired.  Last to get fired. 

While LLMs might be able to replace the average programmer 
(\*)
the point of being a guru is that you're **not** average.

(\*) (But [maybe not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbDDYKRFjhk). See also [[1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mR4jzEWzN5IQdtfSIovU2-YbEcvCZoaPAp5vDBFejqI/edit?slide=id.g3824839c8bf_4_29#slide=id.g3824839c8bf_4_29)] and [[2](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fjxnlqgt8l4uf1.jpeg)].)

The guru engineer is the one who stands out in the IT crowd.
When the stuff hits the fan, they are the ones who fix things, quickest.
They know more than everyone else. They know how to improve everyone
else's code, possessing a clear, unshakeable vision of what separates
good work from bad. They identify friction and fix it rather than
living with it, offering clear, succinct principles during code
reviews that elevate the entire team's standard. By bridging the
gap between raw coding speed and enduring engineering value, the
guru becomes the team's anchor.

To achieve this, one must go beyond the standard curriculum.  Its not about
knowing XYZ, but knowing how to know what matters, for whatever it is you
are doing. Its not having a full tank, but knowing how to fill it further.
While
[other subjects](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) cover the critical
"how" of our trade—mastering the command line, editors, and version
control—true craftsmanship requires pairing this proficiency with
the "why." We must fuse technical agility with timeless Software
Engineering principles that transcend any single language
(things like YAGNI,
DRY, Separation of Concerns, Dependency Injection, VITAL, etc etc). This combination transforms
you from a passive user of tools into an architect of control.

We define this control through the motto: "Own what matters (VITAL),
skip what doesn't (since, YAGNI)." Inspired by the "backpacking" mindset
that built SQLite, we prioritize self-reliance and portability over
dependency bloat. While modern development often adds complexity
via heavy containers and shifting package managers, we champion
lightweight, readable solutions that start fast and leave nothing
behind. By acquiring your vital infrastructure locally, you build
methods that survive the rise and fall of trends, ensuring your
work remains accessible to future generations.
